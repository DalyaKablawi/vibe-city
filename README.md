## Repository for Project 1 titled Vibe City

## WELCOME TO VIBE CITY!!! THE VIBE-STATE AREA WELCOMES YOU!!

### Project Title

        Vibe City

### Project Description

Vibe City is a collection of Vibe Walls embedded within the Vibe-State Area landing page. The mission of our Vibe Walls are to provide any user with the digital projection of their physical vibe onto their computer screen.

To accomplish our mission, we provide the user with a basic interface on our landing page allowing them to select one of our four Vibe Walls, along with a randomized option that will take you to one of our four Vibe Walls at random.

Each Vibe Wall was designed with the user experience in mind:

**Features:**

**1. Quote of the Wall:** Below every Vibe Wall title is a quote that the user needs to hear if they selected that vibe. The Quote of the Wall is not dynamically generated/updated at this time, and instead has to be updated manually in our HTML.

**2. Emoji Avatar:** In the top left corner of every Vibe Wall, we have an emoji avatar that personifies the vibe of the Vibe Wall that the user selected on our landing page.

**3. YouTube LivePlay:** On the left side of every Vibe Wall exists our YouTube LivePlay. This is a video that perfectly paralells the vibe the user selected on our landing page, and begins autoplaying as soon as the user enters the Vibe Wall.

**4. Vibe-Scribes:** In the middle of every Vibe Wall exists our "ADD VIBE-SCRIBE" button. If you are feeling some type of way, be sure to write out your vibe and how you are feeling by clicking on the "ADD VIBE-SCRIBE" button. Once clicked, a modal will appear where you will enter the name of your vibe and a text area to describe your vibe. Once submitted, the modal will dissapear and the vibe you just scribed will live in the middle of the Vibe Wall as a Vibe-Scribe.

**5. VibeLists:** On the right side of every Vibe Wall lives our VibeLists. Vibelists are playlists that comtain links to up to 6 different playlist options that personify the vibe of the respective Vibe Wall. The user knows to click on the playlists because of the hover color-change, and the user will be taken to a new tab if the opt to listen to one of our hand-selected playlists.

**6. Request-A-Vibe:** In the footer of each of our Vibe Walls, we have our Request-A-Vibe option. Didn't see the vibe of your dreams? Let us know! If you click on this button, you will be prompted to enter some basic user information along with a detailed title and description for the vibe you are looking for.

**How-To-Use for User:**

    1. User selects one of five vibe options from our landing page (middle button = randomized option).

    2. Once on the Vibe Wall of their choice, user interacts with the various elements on the webpage (VibeScribes, VibeLists, YouTube LivePlay, Request-A-Vibe)

### User Story

When I select a mood from the options available, I am taken to a separate page where I am immersed in an appropriate vibe/aesthetic.

When I want to switch to a different mood, I can select another mood from the navbar on hover.

If I want to select a wildcard, I can click the “random” button to generate a random page.

If I want to request another mood, I can navigate to a “Request Mood/Talk to the developers” page from the nav bar.

### Acceptance Criteria

For each mood page, I see a vibe wall, different font styles and colours.

Each mood page will have blank notepads where users can input text including reminders, reflections of the day, manifestations, checklist, important tasks.

Dropdown box with options: checklist, blank note.

Local storage will render the inputted text on the page.

Quote of the day for each mood page.

### Process

**Technologies used:**

1. Bootstrap styling for CSS
2. GitHub to host remote repository / github pages for live url
3. VS code for code creation / editing & go live testing / debugging
4. Trello for task delegation
5. Figma for wireframe development

**Breakdown of tasks and roles:**

Step 1: Created our Trello, figma, github repo, base code files
Step 2: Everyone created a single feature on our happy wall
Step 3: Once we perfected the happy wall, we replicated that process on the other walls
Step 4: Team collab on landing Page

**Challenges:**

**1. Javascript issues with local storage.**
It was a challenge trying to create functions to store our modal user inputs into local storage. Since we were are not currently doing anything with the user data, this is not as big of an issue at the moment but we faced significant challenges getting the footer modal to save to local storage.
**2. CSS vs Bootstrap styling & positioning elements on the page**
We faced immense issues relying solely on Bootstrap to position HTML elements on our page. We ended up using a blend of custom CSS and Bootsrap styling/positioning that allowed us to reach our final product. We had to move from a Bootsrap flexbox strategy to using custom CSS containers, custom CSS rules, and the "d-flex" Bootstrap class to contain elements to the length of their content.
**3. Making web page responsive**
Due to the high amount of HTML elements that we have existing on each Vibe Wall, it took us a bit of debugging to figure out our web page respoinsiveness.

**Successes:**

1. Working as a team to move past challenges cohesively
2. Utilizing Figma, Trello, efficient communication to meet deadlines and develop faster
3. Utilizing creativity to maximize space on our webpage and provide more features for our users

### Directions for future development

Our goals for future development include but are not limited to:

1. Adding more emotions to the vibe wall options. We believe an expansive list of vibes will be a big value prop for our site moving forward.
2. Adding Date & Time to Vibe Walls. We believe giving the user an element of time is essential for the vibe wall experience.
3. Instead of a single YouTube video autoplaying, we would like to see a multitude of YouTube videos auto playing when the user accesses a singular vibe wall.
4. We would love to build more proprietary live image backgrounds that we own the license too and that really immerse the user in a moving lava-lamp experience on each vibe wall.
5. We believe giving the user the option to upload their own media into the vibe wall HTML elements in the form of a button.

This list also does not fully capture the scope of our future goals; however, it encompasses our immediate priorities as VibeNation Studios.
